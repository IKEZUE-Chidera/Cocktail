In the **Cocktails API project**, users will be able to search for cocktails by typing their names into a search form. Key features of the project include:

### Project Features:
1. **Search Functionality**:
   - Users can type cocktail names into a search form, which triggers a search event without the need for a submit button.
   - Results will display a list of cocktails, including their names and images.

2. **Detailed Information**:
   - Each cocktail in the list will have a link to a separate page that provides more detailed information about that specific cocktail.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - If no cocktails match the search, a message will inform the user: "Sorry, no drinks matched your search."

### Additional Notes:
- The project will cover various concepts and functionalities, making it more extensive than previous projects.
- The project will utilize the **Cocktail DB API** for fetching cocktail data.
